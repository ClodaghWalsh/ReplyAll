I love the podcast ReplyAll, but explaining what "a podcast about the internet" is about is... tough. I turned to Natural Language Processing for help.

I also attempt to give data-driven guidance to the most important listener question, *are you a PJ or an Alex?* (the computer doesn't see a difference)
